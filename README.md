# Project Background
A simple note-taking app developed using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript framework, which is something new I picked up during my vacation and wanted to experiment with through this concept. Bootstrap is also applied to enable smooth transition between mobile and web interfaces and make this compatible on any device it's loaded upon.

### Other Notes
1. This project has **no association to any other note-taking apps in real life**. Purely developed for experimenting purposes.
2. To view the app, simply download the codes into Visual Studio Code and **right-click** to open in browser.
